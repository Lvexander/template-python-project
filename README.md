## Setting Up the Development Environment

To simplify the setup of the development environment, a `Makefile` is included in this project. The `venv` target is used to install the project dependencies and activate the virtual environment managed by Poetry.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Run the following command:

   ```sh
   make venv
   ```

3. The command will:
   - Install all the required dependencies.
   - Automatically activate the virtual environment.

After running the command, your terminal prompt may change to indicate that the virtual environment is active (e.g., `(project-name)`).



## Duplicating the .env File
To set up your environment variables, you need to duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. You can do this manually or using the following terminal command:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

This command creates a copy of `.env.example` and names it `.env`, allowing you to configure your environment variables specific to your setup.
